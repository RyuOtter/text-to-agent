If you prefer to drive, there are several car parks and parking options available.\n\nTo get a better sense of the city's layout, I can suggest some popular areas to explore. The city centre is home to many of the main attractions, including the famous King's College Chapel and the University of Cambridge. The River Cam runs through the city and offers a picturesque route for walking or taking a punt.\n\nIf you're looking for a more lively atmosphere, the area around Market Square and the Grand Arcade is a great place to explore. You'll find a range of shops, restaurants, and cafes, as well as some great people-watching opportunities.\n\nNow that we've got a better sense of the city's layout, what would you like to do next? Are you looking for accommodation, restaurants, or attractions?", "agent": "I'd be happy to help you with that. Could you provide a bit more detail about what you're looking for?"}]}
