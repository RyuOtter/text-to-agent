And what are some popular events or festivals that are often held in Cambridge?", "agent": "Cambridge is a beautiful city with a rich history and culture. Since you're interested in learning more, I'd like to recommend a few must-visit spots.\n\nOne of the top attractions in Cambridge is the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is located on Trumpington Street. This museum is home to an impressive collection of art and antiquities from around the world, including Egyptian mummies, Greek and Roman artifacts, and a vast array of paintings and sculptures.\n\nAnother iconic landmark is King's College Chapel, a stunning example of Gothic architecture that dates back to the 15th century. The chapel is particularly famous for its intricate stone carvings, stunning stained-glass windows, and the beautiful chapel choir.\n\nCambridge is also home to several world-renowned universities, including the University of Cambridge, which is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world. You can take a stroll through the beautiful college grounds, visit the iconic Mathematical Bridge, or take a punt down the River Cam to see the city from a different perspective.\n\nAs for historical sites, I recommend visiting the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial, which is a poignant tribute to the American servicemen who lost their lives during World War II. You can also explore the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, which features a fascinating collection of artifacts from around the world.\n\nIn terms of popular events and festivals, Cambridge hosts a wide range of cultural and entertainment events throughout the year. Some of the highlights include the Cambridge Folk Festival, the Cambridge Summer Music Festival, and the Cambridge Beer Festival. You can also catch a performance at the Cambridge Theatre, which hosts a variety of productions, from classical music to comedy shows.\n\nIf you're visiting in the summer, be sure to check out the Cambridge Midsummer Fair, which features live music, food stalls, and a range of activities for all ages. And if you're interested in science and technology, you might enjoy the Cambridge Science Festival, which celebrates the latest breakthroughs and innovations in the field.\n\nOverall, Cambridge is a city that has something for everyone, whether you're interested in history, culture, science, or entertainment.

Since you're looking for an expensive Italian restaurant, I could suggest some upscale restaurants in Cambridge that serve a variety of cuisines, but are often associated with an Italian twist or have Italian influences.\n\nFor example, you might consider:\n\n1. The University Arms - This 5-star hotel has a restaurant that serves modern British cuisine with some Italian influences. Their prices are around \u00a350-\u00a370 per person for a three-course meal.\nPhone number: 01223 515 155\n\n2. Hotel Felix - This boutique hotel has a restaurant that serves contemporary British cuisine with some Italian touches. Their prices are around \u00a340-\u00a360 per person for a three-course meal.\nPhone number: 01223 565 565\n\n3. The Varsity Hotel - This 4-star hotel has a restaurant that serves modern British cuisine with some Italian influences. Their prices are around \u00a330-\u00a350 per person for a three-course meal.\nPhone number: 01223 366 606\n\nPlease note that these options may not be strictly Italian, but they do have Italian influences and are generally considered high-end dining options in Cambridge.\n\nWould you like me to provide more information about any of these restaurants, or would you like me to suggest other options?", "agent": "It seems like none of the Italian restaurants I was looking for were found. However, I appreciate you suggesting some alternative options in Cambridge that have Italian influences.\n\nIf you'd like, I can consider the options you provided. Based on your suggestions, here are a few details:\n\n- The University Arms has a 5-star rating, serves modern British cuisine with Italian influences, and costs around 50-70 pounds per person for a three-course meal.\n- Hotel Felix serves contemporary British cuisine with Italian touches and costs around 40-60 pounds per person for a three-course meal.\n- The Varsity Hotel has a 4-star rating, serves modern British cuisine with Italian influences, and costs around 30-50 pounds per person for a three-course meal.\n\nWhich of these options sounds most appealing to you?"}]}
