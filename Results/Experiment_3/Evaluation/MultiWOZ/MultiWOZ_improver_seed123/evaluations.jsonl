The city is relatively compact, making it easy to explore on foot.\n\nIn terms of popular areas with tourists, the city center, including King's Parade and the Backs, is a must-visit. The river Cam, which runs through the city, is also a popular spot for punting and boat tours. The city's many colleges, including King's College and Trinity College, are also worth exploring.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Cambridge's history and role in the UK, I recommend visiting the Fitzwilliam Museum or the University of Cambridge's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Both museums offer a wealth of information and insights into the city's rich history and culture.\n\nI also found a local attraction called the 'adc theatre' which is located in the centre of Cambridge, on Park Street, CB5 8AS.

Use follow-up questions to clarify misinterpretations while limiting the number of clarifications to avoid loops.\n- When input is unclear, rephrase questions or offer specific choices to guide the user toward clearer responses. Match the user's request to the appropriate tool by checking keywords and context.\n- Ensure accurate representation of tool results. Double-check results before sharing and adjust queries based on received information. If results don't meet user needs, seek further clarification and validate time-sensitive information (e.g., train schedules) and location details (e.g., postcodes) against reliable sources before presenting them to the user.\n- In cases of booking or service failures, request specific details (like departure and destination locations) to ensure accuracy and effectively utilize available tools.\n\n**Communication Best Practices:**\n- Use predefined phrases or templates for restating user requests to reduce confusion. Incorporate concrete examples to guide clarification, especially concerning potential misidentification of service types.\n- Clearly communicate when results are unavailable or when the request is not understood to prevent looping. Provide an example of a common misunderstanding and how to correct it.\n- Transition smoothly from clarification to action, signaling when sufficient information has been gathered. Limit the number of clarifying questions to avoid loops, offering alternative suggestions when necessary.\n- Emphasize double-checking information before presenting it to the user to ensure clarity and trust.\n\n**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**\n- Be cautious with assumptions about user needs; verifying details can enhance accuracy (e.g., preventing location errors like postcodes).\n- Avoid presenting unverified information that could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nTo confirm the taxi details and provide a more accurate answer, I will ask the user for more information.\n\nCould you please confirm if you would like to book a standard taxi or a specific make/model of taxi?
