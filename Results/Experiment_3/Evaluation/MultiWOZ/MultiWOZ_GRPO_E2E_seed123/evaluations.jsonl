Unfortunately, the provided information doesn't specify its address or other details. However, I can tell you that the attraction type is 'Church'. If you'd like to know more, I can suggest checking online directories or the official website of the church for more information.\n\nAs for the church's details, I found that it's located at 6 Trinity St, Cambridge CB2 3HX. It's a beautiful church that dates back to the 14th century and features stunning architecture and a peaceful atmosphere.
