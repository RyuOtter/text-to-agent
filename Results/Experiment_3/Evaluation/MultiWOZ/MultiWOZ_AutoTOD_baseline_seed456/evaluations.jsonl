Could you help me find information about train schedules and travel times from Cambridge to Ely?", "agent": "I'd be happy to help you with your questions.\n\nFirstly, regarding Parker's Piece, it's a historic park in Cambridge that has a rich history dating back to the 13th century. The site was originally a common grazing area for the city's residents, but over the centuries, it has been used for various purposes, including as a site for public executions, a parade ground for the city's militia, and even a venue for cricket matches. In the 19th century, the park was redesigned and landscaped, and it has since become a popular spot for recreation and relaxation.\n\nOne notable figure associated with Parker's Piece is Charles Wordsworth, who was a Cambridge University student and a friend of Charles Darwin. Wordsworth was a keen cricketer and helped to popularize the sport in Cambridge.\n\nAs for Charlie Chan, I'd be happy to help you confirm the details. However, I don't have any information about a specific Charlie Chan restaurant in my previous response. Could you please provide me with more context or details about the Charlie Chan restaurant you're looking for, such as its location or the type of cuisine it serves?\n\nRegarding your train query, I found some information about train schedules and travel times from Cambridge to Ely on Tuesday. There are several trains available, but the first one that catches my eye is the train that departs from Cambridge at 13:50 and arrives in Ely at 14:07. This train has a duration of 17 minutes and costs 4.40 pounds. Would you like to know more about this train or would you like me to look into other options?"}]}
