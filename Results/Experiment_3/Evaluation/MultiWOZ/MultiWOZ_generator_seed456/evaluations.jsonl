I'll re-run the search with the updated parameters.\n\nBased on the previous searches, I've found a few options:\n\n1. The train TR0992 departs from Cambridge at 18:11 and arrives at Kings Lynn at 18:58.\n2. The train TR7604 departs from Cambridge at 19:11 and arrives at Kings Lynn at 19:58 (not the earlier departure I mentioned).\n3.
