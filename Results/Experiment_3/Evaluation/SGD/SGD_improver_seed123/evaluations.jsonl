Think big festivals, pulsating beats, and a lively atmosphere.\n\nHouse music is a sub-genre of EDM that originated in the 1980s in Chicago and New York City. It's characterized by its soulful, melodic sound, often with a strong emphasis on rhythm and groove. Expect catchy melodies, deep basslines, and a sense of euphoria.\n\nTechno is another sub-genre of EDM that originated in Detroit in the 1980s. It's known for its minimalist, repetitive beats, often with a focus on machinery and technology. Techno is often darker and more experimental than House or EDM, with a strong emphasis on atmosphere and texture.\n\nIf you're new to these sub-genres, I recommend starting with some popular artists or playlists to get a feel for each style. You might enjoy the likes of Calvin Harris, David Guetta, or Swedish House Mafia for EDM, Daft Punk, Disclosure, or Disclosure for House, and Jeff Mills, Juan Atkins, or Chris Liebing for Techno.\n\nWhich one of these sub-genres resonates with you the most, or would you like me to recommend some specific artists or playlists to get you started?"}, {"turn_idx": 5, "user": "I'm glad I could give you a better understanding of the Dance music sub-genres.
