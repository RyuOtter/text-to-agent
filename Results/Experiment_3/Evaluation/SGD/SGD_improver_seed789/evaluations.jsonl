The crowds are smaller compared to the peak season, making it easier to explore the city's attractions.\n\nAs for festivals and events, Delhi hosts various cultural and religious festivals throughout the year.

However, I can suggest exploring popular street food markets like Chandni Chowk or Sarojini Nagar, which offer a wide variety of chaat and kebab options.\n\nRegarding the Red Fort and Qutub Minar, both are must-visit historical monuments in Delhi. The Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was the main residence of the Mughal emperors from the 17th to the 19th century. When you visit, you can expect to see stunning architecture, including the Diwan-i-Khas (a hall of private audience), the Diwan-i-Am (a hall of public audience), and the Lahore Gate (the main entrance to the fort). The Red Fort is open from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM, and tickets cost 50.\n\nThe Qutub Minar, on the other hand, is the tallest minaret in India and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

When you visit, you can expect to see intricate stone carvings, stunning architecture, and a glimpse into Delhi's rich history.

It's a bit more upscale, but there are still some more affordable options available.\n\nLastly, if you're looking for a more laid-back, beachy vibe, you might want to consider the Pacific Beach or Mission Beach neighborhoods.

For example, if you want to search for flights on a specific date, you can enter \"2024-03-15\" for March 15th, 2024.\n\nRegarding your question about upgrading to Premium Economy, it depends on the airline and their policies. Some airlines may offer upgrade options from Economy to Premium Economy, while others may require you to book a new ticket. It's best to check with the airline directly to see what options are available.\n\nAs for searching for flights with specific airlines that offer Premium Economy, here are a few examples of airlines that might offer this service on the LAX to SFO route:\n\n- American Airlines\n- Delta Air Lines\n- United Airlines\n- Air Canada\n- Alaska Airlines\n\nTo specify these airlines in your search, you can simply select them from the list of available airlines when prompted.
