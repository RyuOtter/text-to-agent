The star rating system is a widely used method to rate the quality and amenities of hotels.

It's often more affordable than a 4-star or 5-star hotel, but still offers a comfortable and clean stay.\n\nHowever, I should note that the star rating system is not always a reliable indicator of a hotel's quality, as it can vary from one hotel to another and even from one region to another.\n\nAs for hotels that are on-site at Disneyland or next to it, within walking distance, there are a few options available. Some hotels that fit this description include:\n\n* Disneyland Hotel: This is a luxury hotel that's actually located on the grounds of Disneyland. It offers a range of amenities, including a private monorail station and multiple pools.\n\n* Disney's Grand Californian Hotel: This is another luxury hotel that's located on the grounds of Disneyland.
