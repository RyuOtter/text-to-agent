It was built in 1648 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who also built the Taj Mahal. The fort is a stunning example of Mughal architecture, with its red sandstone walls and intricate carvings. You can explore the fort's many rooms and courtyards, including the Diwan-i-Khas, where the emperor held court.\n\nThe Qutub Minar, on the other hand, is the tallest minaret in India and a testament to the region's rich Islamic heritage. Built in 1199 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, it stands at an impressive 72.5 meters tall and is adorned with intricate carvings and inscriptions.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the Mughal era and its influence on Delhi's culture and architecture, I recommend visiting the National Museum, which is located on Janpath, New Delhi.
