It's known for its rich history, cultural landmarks, and vibrant street life. As for safety, New Delhi can be a bit crowded and chaotic, but it's generally considered safe for tourists. However, as with any big city, it's always a good idea to be mindful of your surroundings and take necessary precautions.\n\nAerocity, on the other hand, is a more modern area that's been developed specifically for business travelers and tourists. It's located near the airport and offers a more convenient and hassle-free experience. Aerocity is generally considered safe and has a more relaxed atmosphere compared to the hustle and bustle of New Delhi.\n\nIn terms of convenience, Aerocity is likely to be more convenient for travelers, with many amenities and services available within walking distance. New Delhi, while having its own charm, may require a bit more effort to navigate, especially for those who don't speak Hindi or are not familiar with the local customs.\n\nAs for budget-friendliness, both areas have a range of accommodation options available, from budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury hotels. However, Aerocity tends to be more expensive due to its proximity to the airport and the demand for business travel accommodations.\n\nIf you're looking for a more authentic experience and are willing to navigate the crowds, New Delhi might be the better choice for you. However, if you prioritize convenience and a more relaxed atmosphere, Aerocity could be the way to go."}, {"turn_idx": 10, "user": "I'd like to get a better idea of the different areas in Delhi.
