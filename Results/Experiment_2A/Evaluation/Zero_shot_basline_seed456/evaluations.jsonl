You should provide the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-03-15).

You can simply provide the name of the seating class you prefer.\n\n5. **Number of Tickets**: This is the number of passengers traveling. You can provide a whole number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n\n6. **Airlines**: If you have a preferred airline, you can provide its name. However, keep in mind that searching by airline might limit the number of available flights, so it's usually more convenient to leave this field blank and let the search engine suggest multiple airlines.\n\nOnce you have this information, you can use it to search for one-way flights.
