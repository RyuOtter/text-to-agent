Would you like to know more about this event or would you like me to suggest more options?\n\nSince you're interested in learning more about the venue, I found some information about Shakespeare's Globe. It's a historic theater located on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. The current Globe is a reconstruction of the original Elizabethan theater built in 1599. The theater has a unique design, with a thatched roof and a thrust stage that allows the audience to surround the performers on three sides.\n\nAs for the seating arrangement, Shakespeare's Globe has a variety of seating options, including groundlings, who stand in the yard, and seated areas in the galleries. The groundlings are the closest to the stage and are often the most enthusiastic audience members. The seated areas offer a more comfortable viewing experience, but be aware that the theater is not air-conditioned, and the seats can be quite close together.\n\nRegarding special instructions, it's worth noting that Shakespeare's Globe is an outdoor theater, and performances are weather-dependent. In the event of bad weather, the performance may be cancelled or moved to an indoor venue. It's also worth noting that the theater has a strict no-smoking policy and does not allow food or drink to be consumed in the auditorium.\n\nWould you like to know more about the event or the venue, or would you like me to suggest more options for you?"}, {"turn_idx": 5, "user": "I'd love to know more about the event, but I'm still not sure if it's the one I'm looking for.

Along the way, she falls for a man named Orlando, but complications arise due to their social differences. The play is full of witty dialogue, memorable characters, and explores themes of love, identity, and social hierarchy.\n\nAs for what you can expect from the performance, it will likely be a traditional theater production with a talented cast, elaborate costumes, and a beautiful set design. The performance will be held at the Swan, Shakespeare's Globe in London, which is a historic and iconic venue that offers a unique and immersive experience.

However, I noticed that this event is a bit further away than the other one.\n\nA more upcoming event is \"Beirut By Alan Bowne\" at the Shoe Box Theater on March 11th, 2019 at 6:30 PM. The price per ticket for this event is 50.\n\nAs for theaters or venues in Portland known for hosting high-quality theater events, you might want to consider the Newmark Theatre and the Shoe Box Theater. Both of these venues have a reputation for hosting a variety of productions, from classic musicals to more experimental works.\n\nIf you're looking for some recommendations, I'd suggest keeping an eye out for \"Beirut By Alan Bowne\" - it seems like it could be a really interesting and unique production.\n\nDo you think you might be more interested in the school performance or the Beirut By Alan Bowne event?"}]}
