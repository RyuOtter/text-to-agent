It's home to the famous Heritage Square, which features preserved 19th-century buildings, including the Rosson House Museum. You can also find boutique shops, art galleries, and restaurants serving a mix of traditional and modern cuisine.\n\nDowntown Phoenix, on the other hand, is a vibrant area with a blend of old and new architecture. It's the hub for arts and culture, with numerous museums, galleries, and performance venues. You can visit the Heard Museum to learn about Native American art and culture, or catch a show at the Orpheum Theatre.\n\nSome other neighborhoods worth exploring are:\n\n- Roosevelt Row: Known for its street art, trendy restaurants, and boutique shops.\n- Warehouse District: A converted industrial area with converted warehouses now housing art galleries, restaurants, and bars.\n- Encanto: A historic neighborhood with beautiful architecture, parks, and a strong sense of community.\n- Biltmore: An upscale area with high-end shopping centers, restaurants, and luxury hotels.\n\nEach of these neighborhoods offers a unique experience, and they're all within a short drive or ride-share from each other.

Reggaeton is known for its fast-paced, energetic beats and often features lyrics that focus on love, relationships, and street life.\n\nSo, while both genres share some similarities, Reggae tends to be more laid-back and focused on social commentary, whereas Reggaeton is often more upbeat and focused on dance and party culture.\n\nNow, let's get back to \"Who Knows\" by Protoje. This song is a great example of modern Reggae music, with its catchy hooks and socially conscious lyrics.
