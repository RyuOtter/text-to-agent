The band's early sound was heavily influenced by jazz and rock, and they quickly gained a following in the Chicago area. Their first album, \"The Chicago Transit Authority,\" was released in 1969 and featured a mix of rock, jazz, and classical music.\n\nOne of the most interesting periods in Chicago's history is the 1970s, when the band underwent a significant lineup change. Peter Cetera left the band in 1985, but the remaining members continued to tour and record music. They released several successful albums, including \"Chicago 16\" and \"Chicago 17,\" which featured hits like \"Hard Habit to Break\" and \"Will You Still Love Me?\"\n\nChicago has also been known for their live performances, which often feature elaborate lighting and pyrotechnics.
