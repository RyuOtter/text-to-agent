It's a must-visit for history buffs and architecture enthusiasts.\n\nAnother popular spot is the Qutub Minar, the tallest minaret in India and a great example of the country's rich Islamic heritage. It was built in the 12th century and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about India's history and culture, you might want to visit the National Museum, which has a vast collection of artifacts and exhibits that showcase the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\nLastly, the India Gate, a war memorial built in the 1930s, is a popular spot for both locals and tourists. It's a great place to take a stroll and enjoy the city's atmosphere.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many amazing attractions Delhi has to offer.

I found two listings for this hotel in Seattle, both with 4-star ratings and located at 1113 6th Avenue. One listing has 1 room available at $120 per night and does not allow smoking, while the other listing has 3 rooms available at $252 per night and also does not allow smoking. \n\nAs for your request for more options, I found another 4-star hotel in Seattle: the Grand Hyatt Seattle. It's located at 721 Pine Street and has 3 rooms available at $456 per night, with no smoking allowed.\n\nTo calculate the price per night for a 2-night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle, I'd be happy to help. If you book the $456 per night room for 2 nights, the total price would be $912. To find the price per night, I can divide this by 2, which would be $456 per night. \n\nIf you'd like to compare prices and find the best fit for your needs, I can suggest that you consider the Crowne Plaza Seattle Downtown with 1 room available at $120 per night, or the Crowne Plaza Seattle Downtown with 3 rooms available at $252 per night. Alternatively, you could also consider the Grand Hyatt Seattle with 3 rooms available at $456 per night. \n\nWhich of these options would you like to know more about?"}]}
