In the 19th century, composers like Chopin (e.g., \"Piano Concerto No. 2\" in 1830) and Brahms (e.g., \"Symphony No. 3\" in 1883) made significant contributions.\n- **Electronic music**: This genre started to take shape in the mid-20th century, with artists like Karlheinz Stockhausen (e.g., \"Telemusik\" in 1966) and Kraftwerk (e.g., \"Autobahn\" in 1974) experimenting with electronic sounds. In the 1980s, genres like techno and house music emerged (e.g., Detroit techno's \"Nude Photo\" by Juan Atkins in 1985).\n- **Hip-hop/Rap music**: This genre originated in the 1970s (e.g., The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\" in 1979) and gained popularity in the 1980s (e.g., Run-DMC's \"Walk This Way\" in 1986) and 1990s (e.g., Tupac Shakur's \"Hit 'Em Up\" in 1996).\n\nKeep in mind that these are just a few examples, and there's a lot more to explore within each genre.
