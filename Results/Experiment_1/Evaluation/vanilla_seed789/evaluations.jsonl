However, the results I got for you didn't specifically mention Classic Rock. Instead, I found a list of Rock music tracks from different artists and albums.\n\nBut, I can tell you that Classic Rock is a sub-genre of Rock music that originated in the 1960s and 1970s. It typically involves guitar-driven melodies, powerful vocals, and often, a strong emphasis on songwriting and storytelling. Classic Rock artists often draw from blues, folk, and psychedelia to create their unique sound.\n\nSome famous artists associated with Classic Rock include Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Queen, and The Who. These bands helped shape the sound of Classic Rock and continue to influence new generations of musicians.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Classic Rock or would like some specific recommendations, feel free to ask!"}, {"turn_idx": 9, "user": "I'd like to gain information about the music.
